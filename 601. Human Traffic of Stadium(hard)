##SOLUTION:
SELECT DISTINCT s1.* 
FROM stadium AS s1, stadium AS s2,stadium AS s3 
WHERE ((s1.id=s2.id-1 and s2.id=s3.id-1) or (s1.id=s3.id-1 and s3.id=s2.id-1)
        or 
       (s2.id=s1.id-1 and s1.id=s3.id-1) or (s2.id=s3.id-1 and s3.id=s1.id-1)
        or 
       (s3.id=s1.id-1 and s1.id=s2.id-1) or (s3.id=s2.id-1 and s2.id=s1.id-1))
       and
      (s1.people>=100 and s2.people>=100 and s3.people>=100) 
ORDER BY s1.id










X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, visit_date, people

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

For example, the table stadium:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+

For the sample data above, the output is:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Note:
Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.
